# Code-Sample


This work is to reproduce the results of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.04329.pdf of Alexander Terenin, Shawfeng Dong, David Draper.


cuHorse is a Gibbs sampler that is called by horseshoe_probit_regression.R.
horse.R is a standalone implementation of the same program solely in R.

comparing the two represents the speedups achieved by using the CUDA API libraries.

additionally there is an old homework sample.
